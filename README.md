# CellsGame
A Game project I worked on during summer 2015. Currently inactive, but I pushed it because it got some interesting code.

Some documents used to code this:
- Metaball rendering: http://nullcandy.com/2d-metaballs-in-xna/
- Physics: http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/math-and-physics/a-verlet-based-approach-for-2d-game-physics-r2714
